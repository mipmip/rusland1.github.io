  On Zemfira live in Amsterdam, Nov 4, 2024. And on the Russian people over
  there.
intro: >+
  Amsterdam, November 4. In the queue of people waiting in front of the doors of
  AFAS. Where Zemfira will soon be performing. Left, right, front and back:
  Russian everywhere. My company almost feels at home.

When I dare to speak some words in Russian, it is immediately noticed. Hear that, over there, a Dutchman!

<br/>


**DIFFERENT** <br/>
Once inside, it becomes even clearer. Perhaps because the coats are now stored, in a safe that causes four times heavy traffic in the corridors. (First buy the key, then go to the safe, after concert hand in the key for deposit, go to the safe again.) It is crowded and hectic and the people are loud.

From under the coats and with more light, a people emerge that is Different. Different from ours, different from what's familiar. Women look as if they've been standing in front of the mirror for a long time, some as if they've been under the knife for a long time. Russian is heard everywhere, a vibe new to me fills the air.

<br/>

**FINALLY** <br/>
Zemfira also does not seem to assume there is anyone in the room who does not know Russian. Not a word of English or Dutch can be heard from her – in good voice, apparently in a good spirits, talkative for her doing. I am half a stowaway, half a tourist. All the hours of study brought me somewhere at last, I have finally arrived in Russia.

The Russians sing along as if they too are all back home again. With Бесконечность, with пальто, with Жить в твоей голове, with Любовь как случайн ая смерть, with Почему – 25 years old, and no one seems tired of it yet –, with the cover of [Печаль](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKQW3SSqAxw), with Мы разбиваемся, and with a [Спасибо](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CM_ZbAkGOns).* Set list [here]( https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/zemfira/2024/afas-live-amsterdam-netherlands-6b543e16.html).

<br/>

**FRIENDLY** <br/>
In the queue before the start, a lively conversation emerged, with a Russian guy from Germany and, we suspected, his sister. According to Katya, he was stoned.
They had heard right away that I was not from Russia. That was a bit discouraging.
But they thought it was quite something, a Dutchman who could speak a little Russian. The Russians seemed like a friendly people to me, stoned or not.

All my photos were a failure. But a pleasant evening, in this Little Russia..<br/>
As for the Big one: I'll be going there next year.<br/>
To be continued!
